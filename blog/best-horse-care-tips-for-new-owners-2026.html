    {"@type": "Question", "name": "How much hay does a horse eat per day?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "A horse eats approximately 1.5% to 2% of its body weight in forage (hay or pasture grass) per day. For a 1,000-pound horse, that is 15 to 20 pounds of hay daily, typically split into 2 to 3 feedings. Horses are designed to eat small amounts continuously throughout the day, so providing hay in slow-feed hay nets that extend eating time is better for digestive health than feeding large meals twice daily. Quality grass hay (timothy, orchard grass, or bermuda) is the foundation of most horse diets. Alfalfa hay is higher in protein and calories and is appropriate for horses in heavy work, growing young horses, and lactating mares, but can cause weight gain in easy keepers. Always ensure hay is free of mold, dust, and weeds."}},
    {"@type": "Question", "name": "How often should a horse see the farrier?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Horses need farrier visits every 6 to 8 weeks, regardless of whether they wear shoes or go barefoot. Hooves grow continuously, like human fingernails, and need regular trimming to maintain proper balance and prevent problems like cracking, flaring, and uneven wear. Shod horses (wearing metal horseshoes) need resets or new shoes every 6 to 8 weeks because the shoe prevents natural wear. Barefoot horses need trimming on the same schedule to maintain correct hoof shape and balance. Skipping farrier visits leads to overgrown hooves that alter the horse's movement and can cause lameness, joint stress, and structural problems. A basic barefoot trim costs $35 to $50, while a full shoeing (all four feet) costs $100 to $200 depending on your region and the type of shoes."}},
    {"@type": "Question", "name": "What vaccinations does a horse need?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "The American Association of Equine Practitioners (AAEP) classifies horse vaccines into core and risk-based categories. Core vaccines that every horse should receive annually include: Eastern Equine Encephalomyelitis (EEE), Western Equine Encephalomyelitis (WEE), Tetanus, West Nile Virus, and Rabies. Risk-based vaccines depend on your horse's lifestyle, geographic location, and exposure risk: Influenza (recommended every 6 months for horses that travel or are in contact with other horses), Rhinopneumonitis (EHV-1 and EHV-4), Strangles, Potomac Horse Fever, and Botulism. Vaccination schedules should be designed by your veterinarian based on your specific situation. Annual vaccination costs typically range from $150 to $300 depending on which vaccines are administered."}},
    {"@type": "Question", "name": "How do I know if my horse is sick?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Learn your horse's normal vital signs so you can detect abnormalities. Normal resting heart rate is 28 to 44 beats per minute (check with a stethoscope behind the left elbow). Normal respiratory rate is 8 to 15 breaths per minute at rest. Normal rectal temperature is 99.5 to 101.5 degrees Fahrenheit. Signs of illness include: refusing food or water (a horse that does not eat for more than 12 hours needs veterinary attention), lethargy or depression, pawing, rolling, or looking at the flanks (signs of colic, a potentially life-threatening digestive emergency), nasal discharge (especially if thick, yellow, or green), coughing, swollen legs or joints, lameness, diarrhea, excessive sweating at rest, and changes in manure consistency or frequency. When in doubt, call your veterinarian. Early intervention is almost always less expensive and more effective than waiting."}},
    {"@type": "Question", "name": "How much water does a horse drink per day?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "A horse drinks 5 to 10 gallons of water per day under normal conditions. In hot weather or during exercise, water consumption can increase to 15 to 20 gallons per day. Horses must have access to clean, fresh water 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. Dehydration in horses can become dangerous within 24 to 48 hours and can trigger impaction colic (a blockage in the digestive tract). In winter, horses often reduce water intake because they do not like drinking ice-cold water. Using heated water buckets or tank heaters that maintain water temperature above 45 degrees Fahrenheit encourages adequate winter hydration. Check water troughs and buckets daily for cleanliness, adequate levels, and proper function of automatic waterers."}},
    {"@type": "Question", "name": "How often should I deworm my horse?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Modern deworming protocols have shifted from rotational deworming every 8 weeks (which contributed to parasite resistance) to targeted deworming based on fecal egg counts. Have your veterinarian perform a fecal egg count (FEC) test 2 to 4 times per year. Horses with low egg counts (under 200 eggs per gram) may only need deworming 1 to 2 times per year. Horses with high egg counts (over 500 EPG) may need deworming 3 to 4 times per year. All horses should be dewormed with ivermectin or moxidectin in late fall to target encysted small strongyle larvae. Praziquantel should be included once or twice per year to target tapeworms. A single fecal egg count test costs $15 to $35, and targeted deworming costs $8 to $15 per treatment."}}

<h2 id="daily-routine">Establishing a Daily Care Routine</h2>

<p>Horses thrive on routine. Their stress levels decrease, their digestive systems function optimally, and their behavior becomes more predictable when daily activities happen at consistent times. As a new horse owner, establishing a structured daily care routine is the foundation of good horse management and will quickly become second nature.</p>

<p>A typical daily routine for a horse involves two main care sessions: morning and evening. The morning session includes feeding breakfast (hay and grain if applicable), checking water troughs, performing a quick health check (eyes, legs, body condition, attitude), picking hooves, and turning out to pasture or setting up the stall for the day. The evening session includes feeding dinner, checking water again, another health check, grooming if not done earlier, and preparing the horse for the night (stall or pasture depending on your management system).</p>

<p>Total daily time commitment for basic horse care is approximately 1 to 2 hours, split between morning and evening. This does not include riding or training time, which adds 1 to 2 additional hours on days you ride. On weekdays when time is limited, the minimum care (feeding, watering, health check, hoof pick) can be accomplished in 30 to 45 minutes per session. On weekends, allocate extra time for thorough grooming, equipment maintenance, and facility cleaning.</p>

<p>Consistency in feeding times is particularly important. Horses have a highly sensitive digestive system designed for continuous grazing. Feeding at irregular times or making sudden changes to feed type or quantity can trigger colic (abdominal pain that ranges from mild to life-threatening) and other digestive problems. Aim to feed within the same 30-minute window each day.</p>

<h2 id="feeding">Feeding Your Horse: Hay, Grain, and Supplements</h2>

<h3>Forage: The Foundation of Every Horse Diet</h3>
<p>Forage (hay and/or pasture grass) should constitute 70% to 100% of your horse's diet by weight. Horses evolved to eat fibrous plant material for 16 to 18 hours per day, and their digestive system is specifically designed for continuous fiber intake. The minimum daily forage requirement is 1.5% of body weight; the recommended amount is 2% of body weight. For a 1,000-pound horse, that is 15 to 20 pounds of hay per day.</p>

<p>The most common hay types for horses are timothy, orchard grass, bermuda (warm climate), and brome. These grass hays provide appropriate calorie and protein levels for most adult horses in light to moderate work. Alfalfa hay is higher in protein (15 to 22% vs 8 to 12% for grass hay) and calories, making it appropriate for horses in heavy work, growing foals, and lactating mares, but too rich for easy keepers and idle horses.</p>

<p>Evaluate hay quality before purchasing by examining color (should be green, not brown or yellow), smell (should smell sweet and fresh, never musty or moldy), texture (should be leafy with fine stems, not coarse or stemmy), and absence of weeds, dirt, and foreign objects. Dusty or moldy hay can cause respiratory disease and should never be fed. A <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1580175619?tag=spunk01-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">comprehensive horse care manual</a> provides detailed guidance on evaluating and selecting hay.</p>

<h3>Grain and Concentrates</h3>
<p>Many adult horses in light work do not need grain at all. Quality forage plus a vitamin/mineral supplement (called a ration balancer) provides complete nutrition for horses maintaining healthy body condition on hay alone. Grain (oats, sweet feed, pelleted feeds) is a concentrated energy source appropriate for horses in moderate to heavy work, horses that cannot maintain weight on forage alone, and growing young horses.</p>

<p>If grain is necessary, feed the minimum amount needed to maintain appropriate body condition. Overfeeding grain is one of the most common mistakes new horse owners make, and it can cause laminitis (a painful, potentially crippling hoof condition), colic, metabolic problems, and behavioral issues from excess energy. A typical grain ration for a horse in moderate work is 3 to 6 pounds per day, split into 2 to 3 meals. Never feed more than 5 pounds of grain in a single meal.</p>

<h3>Supplements</h3>
<p>The supplement industry for horses is vast and largely unregulated, and most healthy horses on quality forage do not need supplements beyond a ration balancer to fill nutritional gaps in hay. A ration balancer provides vitamins, minerals, and amino acids without significant calories, costing $30 to $50 per month. Salt is the one supplement every horse needs: provide a plain white salt block or loose salt (1 to 2 ounces per day) in addition to regular feed.</p>

<h2 id="water">Water Requirements and Hydration</h2>

<p>Horses drink 5 to 10 gallons of water per day under normal conditions and up to 15 to 20 gallons in hot weather or during exercise. Clean, fresh water must be available 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. Dehydration is dangerous in horses and can trigger impaction colic (a blockage in the large intestine) within 24 to 48 hours of restricted water intake.</p>

<p>Check water sources at least twice daily for cleanliness, adequate levels, and proper function of automatic waterers. Scrub water troughs and buckets weekly to prevent algae growth and bacterial contamination. In summer, algae can render a water source unpalatable within days. Adding a tablespoon of apple cider vinegar per 5 gallons of water helps inhibit algae growth without affecting palatability.</p>

<p>In winter, horses often reduce water intake because they dislike drinking ice-cold water. This reduced intake during cold weather is a leading cause of winter impaction colic. Using heated water buckets or tank heaters that maintain water temperature above 45 degrees Fahrenheit (7 degrees Celsius) encourages adequate hydration throughout winter. A <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0029Q4WIS?tag=spunk01-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">heated water bucket</a> costs $30 to $60 and is an essential winter investment.</p>

<h2 id="grooming">Daily Grooming: Tools and Techniques</h2>

<p>Grooming is not just about making your horse look clean. It is a health check, a bonding activity, and a way to maintain skin and coat health. Regular grooming stimulates blood circulation, distributes natural oils, removes dirt and dead hair, and gives you the opportunity to detect cuts, swelling, heat, ticks, and other abnormalities before they become serious problems.</p>

<h3>Essential Grooming Tools</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rubber curry comb:</strong> Used in circular motions on the body to loosen dirt, mud, and dead hair from the coat. The most important tool in your grooming kit.</li>
<li><strong>Stiff-bristled dandy brush:</strong> Used to flick away the dirt and debris loosened by the curry comb. Use with firm, sweeping strokes in the direction of hair growth.</li>
<li><strong>Soft-bristled body brush:</strong> Used after the dandy brush for finishing. Removes fine dust and distributes natural oils for a smooth, glossy coat.</li>
<li><strong>Mane and tail comb/brush:</strong> Used to detangle mane and tail. Always work from the bottom up to avoid pulling and breaking hairs. A detangling spray reduces breakage.</li>
<li><strong>Hoof pick:</strong> Used daily to clean dirt, rocks, and debris from the underside of each hoof. Essential for detecting early signs of hoof problems like thrush.</li>
<li><strong>Soft cloth or towel:</strong> Used to wipe around the eyes, nostrils, and dock (under the tail) where brushes are too harsh.</li>
</ul>

<p>A complete grooming kit costs $20 to $40 for quality tools that will last several years. A <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BF38MTR1?tag=spunk01-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">grooming kit set</a> with all essential tools provides a convenient starting point for new owners.</p>

<h3>Grooming Sequence</h3>
<p>Start with the curry comb on the body (avoiding bony areas like the face, legs below the knee, and spine). Move to the dandy brush, then the body brush. Comb the mane and tail gently. Pick all four hooves. Wipe the face, eyes, and nostrils with a damp cloth. The entire process takes 15 to 25 minutes and should be done before every ride and at least 3 to 4 times per week even on non-riding days.</p>

<h2 id="hoof-care">Hoof Care Basics: Picking, Trimming, and Shoes</h2>

<p>The old saying "no hoof, no horse" reflects the reality that hoof health is fundamental to overall horse soundness. A horse with poor hooves cannot move comfortably, cannot work, and may develop chronic lameness that ends its riding career. Daily hoof care and regular farrier visits are non-negotiable aspects of horse ownership.</p>

<h3>Daily Hoof Picking</h3>
<p>Pick your horse's hooves daily, before and after every ride. To pick a hoof, stand beside the horse's shoulder (for front feet) or hip (for hind feet), run your hand down the leg, and squeeze the tendons above the fetlock joint while leaning your body weight gently against the horse. Most trained horses will lift their foot in response. Use the hoof pick to clean from heel to toe, working the pick along the grooves (called sulci) on either side of the frog (the V-shaped structure on the underside of the hoof). Remove all packed dirt, rocks, manure, and debris.</p>

<p>While picking, inspect for signs of problems: a foul smell indicates thrush (a bacterial/fungal infection of the frog), loose or shifted shoes indicate the need for an early farrier visit, cracks in the hoof wall may indicate structural issues, and heat in the hoof compared to the other feet may indicate injury or the beginning of laminitis.</p>

<h3>Farrier Schedule</h3>
<p>Schedule farrier visits every 6 to 8 weeks. Your farrier will trim excess hoof growth to maintain proper balance and angle, check for developing problems, and reset or replace shoes if your horse is shod. The decision to shoe or go barefoot depends on your horse's hoof quality, the terrain you ride on, and your horse's level of work. Many horses do well barefoot with regular trimming, while others need shoes for protection on rocky terrain or correction of hoof imbalances.</p>

<h2 id="health-checks">Daily Health Checks Every Owner Should Do</h2>

<p>A quick daily health check takes 5 minutes and can catch problems before they become emergencies. Make this part of your morning routine. Learning what is normal for your specific horse is essential so you can detect changes early.</p>

<div class="product-card">
<h3>Normal Vital Signs for Adult Horses</h3>
<p><strong>Heart Rate:</strong> 28 to 44 beats per minute at rest</p>
<p><strong>Respiratory Rate:</strong> 8 to 15 breaths per minute at rest</p>
<p><strong>Temperature:</strong> 99.5 to 101.5 degrees Fahrenheit (rectal)</p>
<p><strong>Gut Sounds:</strong> Active gurgling on both sides of the abdomen</p>
<p><strong>Capillary Refill Time:</strong> Under 2 seconds (press gum, observe pink color return)</p>
<p><strong>Gum Color:</strong> Pink and moist (not pale, blue, purple, or bright red)</p>
</div>

<h3>Daily Check Routine</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Attitude and behavior:</strong> Is your horse alert, interested in food, and acting normally? Depression, lethargy, or unusual behavior warrants closer investigation.</li>
<li><strong>Eyes:</strong> Should be bright and clear with no discharge, swelling, or cloudiness.</li>
<li><strong>Nostrils:</strong> Should be clear. A small amount of clear discharge is normal. Thick, colored, or foul-smelling discharge is not.</li>
<li><strong>Legs:</strong> Run your hands down all four legs, feeling for heat, swelling, bumps, or sensitivity. Compare both front legs and both hind legs to each other.</li>
<li><strong>Body condition:</strong> Check for new cuts, scrapes, bumps, swelling, or areas of hair loss. Observe whether the horse moves freely or shows signs of stiffness or lameness.</li>
<li><strong>Manure:</strong> Should be formed into moist, dark-green to brown balls that break apart on impact. Dry, hard pellets indicate dehydration. Loose or watery manure indicates digestive upset.</li>
<li><strong>Hooves:</strong> Pick and inspect during daily grooming.</li>
</ol>

<div class="tip-box">
<strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Take your horse's vital signs when it is healthy and resting so you know its individual baseline. Normal ranges vary between horses, and knowing that your horse's resting heart rate is normally 32 BPM makes it much more meaningful when you measure 52 BPM on a day when the horse seems off. Record baseline vitals and keep them posted in the barn.
</div>

<h2 id="vaccinations">Vaccination Schedule and Preventive Care</h2>

<p>Vaccinations are one of the most cost-effective investments in your horse's health. The diseases they prevent, including tetanus, rabies, encephalitis, and West Nile virus, range from debilitating to fatal, and treatment for these diseases (when treatment is even possible) costs thousands of dollars compared to $150 to $300 annually for vaccination.</p>

<h3>Core Vaccines (Required for All Horses)</h3>
<table>
<thead><tr><th>Vaccine</th><th>Frequency</th><th>Protects Against</th></tr></thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td>Tetanus Toxoid</td><td>Annual</td><td>Clostridium tetani (fatal in 80% of unvaccinated horses)</td></tr>
<tr><td>Eastern/Western Encephalomyelitis</td><td>Annual (spring)</td><td>Mosquito-borne brain inflammation (60-90% mortality)</td></tr>
<tr><td>West Nile Virus</td><td>Annual (spring)</td><td>Mosquito-borne neurological disease</td></tr>
<tr><td>Rabies</td><td>Annual</td><td>Rabies virus (100% fatal once clinical signs appear)</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<h3>Risk-Based Vaccines (Discuss with Your Veterinarian)</h3>
<table>
<thead><tr><th>Vaccine</th><th>Frequency</th><th>Recommended For</th></tr></thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td>Influenza</td><td>Every 6 months</td><td>Horses that travel, show, or contact other horses</td></tr>
<tr><td>Rhinopneumonitis (EHV)</td><td>Every 6 months</td><td>Horses at shows, breeding farms</td></tr>
<tr><td>Strangles</td><td>Annual</td><td>Horses at high-density facilities</td></tr>
<tr><td>Potomac Horse Fever</td><td>Annual</td><td>Horses in endemic regions</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<h2 id="dental">Dental Care: Floating and Oral Health</h2>

<p>Horse teeth grow continuously throughout their lives and develop sharp edges, hooks, and ramps that can cause pain, difficulty eating, weight loss, and resistance to the bit during riding. The process of filing down these sharp edges is called "floating," and it should be performed by a veterinarian or licensed equine dentist every 12 months for adult horses and every 6 months for horses under 5 years old (whose teeth are changing rapidly).</p>

<p>Signs of dental problems include dropping food while eating (called quidding), weight loss despite adequate feed, head tilting or tossing while eating, foul-smelling breath, resistance to the bit or bridle, undigested grain in manure, and facial swelling. A dental float appointment costs $100 to $250 and typically includes a full oral examination with a speculum (mouth opener) that allows the veterinarian to see and feel all teeth.</p>

<h2 id="deworming">Modern Deworming Protocols</h2>

<p>The veterinary community has largely moved away from rotational deworming schedules (administering a different class of dewormer every 8 weeks) because decades of this practice has created widespread parasite resistance to common dewormers. The modern approach is targeted deworming based on fecal egg count testing.</p>

<p>Have your veterinarian perform a fecal egg count (FEC) test 2 to 4 times per year. This inexpensive test ($15 to $35) determines how many parasite eggs your horse is shedding, which correlates with its internal parasite load. Horses are categorized as low shedders (under 200 eggs per gram), moderate shedders (200 to 500 EPG), or high shedders (over 500 EPG). Low shedders may only need deworming once or twice per year, while high shedders may need 3 to 4 treatments.</p>

<p>All horses, regardless of FEC results, should receive one ivermectin or moxidectin treatment in late fall (November/December) to target encysted small strongyle larvae, which are not detected by fecal egg counts. Praziquantel should be included 1 to 2 times per year to target tapeworms. This evidence-based approach reduces drug resistance, saves money, and actually controls parasites more effectively than blind rotational deworming.</p>

<h2 id="shelter">Shelter, Bedding, and Living Space</h2>

<p>Horses need shelter from extreme weather but do not necessarily need a barn or stall. A three-sided run-in shed that provides protection from wind, rain, and sun is adequate for most horses in most climates. The minimum size for a run-in shed is 12 feet by 12 feet per horse, with the open side facing away from prevailing winds. For stalled horses, minimum stall size is 12 feet by 12 feet for an average-sized horse, with adequate ventilation (poor barn ventilation is a leading cause of respiratory disease in horses).</p>

<p>If your horse is stalled, bedding absorbs urine, provides cushioning, and encourages the horse to lie down and rest. Common bedding options include wood shavings (most popular, $5 to $8 per bag), straw ($5 to $10 per bale), and pelleted bedding ($6 to $10 per bag, expands when wet). Remove manure and wet spots daily (called "mucking out") and completely strip and replace bedding weekly or biweekly depending on accumulation.</p>

<p>Pasture space requirements are a minimum of 1 to 2 acres per horse for adequate exercise and grazing. Fencing must be horse-safe: avoid barbed wire, which causes severe injuries. Appropriate horse fencing includes board fencing, vinyl fencing, electric tape or rope fencing, and wire mesh with a top rail. All fencing should be at least 4 to 5 feet high and regularly inspected for damage, loose posts, and broken boards or wires.</p>

<h2 id="seasonal">Seasonal Care: Summer and Winter Considerations</h2>

<h3>Summer Care</h3>
<p>Heat stress is a serious risk for horses in summer, especially during exercise. Provide shade and unlimited water at all times. Avoid riding during the hottest part of the day (noon to 4 PM). After exercise in hot weather, cool your horse by hosing cold water over the large blood vessels on the neck, between the hind legs, and on the chest. A horse that is breathing heavily (more than 60 breaths per minute), sweating excessively, or has stopped sweating (a dangerous condition called anhidrosis) needs immediate cooling and veterinary attention.</p>

<p>Fly control is essential for summer comfort. Use a combination of strategies: fly spray (applied before turnout), fly masks (protecting eyes and ears), fly sheets (lightweight mesh body covers), and environmental controls (removing manure from paddocks twice weekly, eliminating standing water where flies breed). Fly predators (parasitic wasps that attack fly pupae) are an effective biological control that costs $25 to $40 per month.</p>

<h3>Winter Care</h3>
<p>Horses handle cold weather better than most owners expect. A healthy horse with a full winter coat can comfortably tolerate temperatures well below freezing without a blanket, as long as it has shelter from wind and rain. Wet and wind are far more dangerous than cold alone. A horse that is wet and exposed to 40-degree temperatures with wind loses more body heat than a dry horse in 10-degree still air.</p>

<p>Blanketing is appropriate for clipped horses, senior horses with poor body condition, sick horses, and horses without adequate shelter. If you blanket, check the blanket daily for shifting, rubbing, and moisture trapped underneath. A blanket that traps moisture against the coat actually makes the horse colder by preventing the coat from lofting and insulating naturally.</p>

<p>The biggest winter risk is dehydration from reduced water intake. Use heated water sources, and consider adding a tablespoon of salt to daily feed to encourage drinking. Increase hay in cold weather: horses generate significant body heat through the fermentation of fiber in their hindgut, so additional hay is the most effective way to keep a horse warm in winter.</p>

<h2 id="faq">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<div class="faq">
<details>
<summary>How much hay does a horse eat per day?</summary>
<p>A horse eats 1.5% to 2% of its body weight in hay daily. For a 1,000-pound horse, that is 15 to 20 pounds per day, split into 2 to 3 feedings. Slow-feed hay nets extend eating time and improve digestive health. Quality grass hay (timothy, orchard grass) is appropriate for most adult horses. Alfalfa is reserved for horses in heavy work or with higher nutritional needs.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>How often should a horse see the farrier?</summary>
<p>Every 6 to 8 weeks, whether shod or barefoot. Hooves grow continuously and need regular trimming to maintain balance and prevent cracking, flaring, and lameness. A barefoot trim costs $35 to $50. Full shoeing (four feet) costs $100 to $200. Skipping farrier visits leads to structural problems and chronic lameness.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>What vaccinations does a horse need?</summary>
<p>Core vaccines required annually: tetanus, Eastern/Western encephalomyelitis, West Nile virus, and rabies. Risk-based vaccines (discuss with your vet): influenza (every 6 months for traveling horses), rhinopneumonitis, strangles, and Potomac Horse Fever. Annual vaccination costs $150 to $300 depending on which vaccines are needed.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>How do I know if my horse is sick?</summary>
<p>Learn normal vital signs (heart rate 28-44 BPM, respiratory rate 8-15, temperature 99.5-101.5F). Warning signs include refusing food for 12+ hours, pawing/rolling/looking at flanks (colic), nasal discharge, coughing, swollen legs, lameness, diarrhea, and lethargy. When in doubt, call your veterinarian. Early intervention is always less expensive.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>How much water does a horse drink per day?</summary>
<p>5 to 10 gallons under normal conditions, up to 15 to 20 gallons in hot weather or during exercise. Fresh, clean water must be available 24/7. In winter, use heated water buckets to keep water above 45F and encourage adequate intake. Dehydration can cause impaction colic within 24 to 48 hours.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>How often should I deworm my horse?</summary>
<p>Use targeted deworming based on fecal egg counts (FEC) performed 2 to 4 times per year by your vet. Low shedders need 1 to 2 treatments per year; high shedders need 3 to 4. All horses should receive ivermectin or moxidectin in late fall for encysted small strongyles, plus praziquantel 1 to 2 times per year for tapeworms.</p>
</details>

<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>Caring for a horse is a daily commitment that rewards you with a partnership unlike any other. The basics are straightforward: provide quality forage and clean water, groom and check hooves daily, schedule regular farrier and veterinary visits, and learn to read your horse's normal behavior so you can detect problems early. The learning curve is steepest in the first few months of ownership, but the skills become routine quickly, and the bond you build through daily care deepens every day.</p>

<p>Invest in knowledge from the start. Take the time to learn your horse's individual normal vital signs, feeding preferences, and behavioral patterns. Build a relationship with a trusted veterinarian and farrier. Join a local horse owner's group or online community where you can ask questions and learn from experienced owners. The equestrian community is overwhelmingly welcoming to newcomers, and the collective knowledge available to you is invaluable.</p>
